Handling Missing Values and Outlier Analyses.
I am given with two csv files. The “pima_indians_diabetes_miss.csv” is a file that contains some missing values. The “pima_indians_diabetes_original.csv” is the 
original file without any missing values. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, USA. The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. 

Following are the details of the attributes in the data:\
• pregs (Pregnancies) : Number of Pregnancies\
• plas (Glucose) : Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.\
• pres (Blood Pressure) : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).\
• skin (Skin Thickness) : Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).\
• test (Insulin) : 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).\
• BMI (BMI) : Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).\
• pedi (Diabetes pedigree function) : Diabetes pedigree function.\
• Age (Age) : Age of patients (years).\
• Class (Outcome) : Class variable (0 or 1). 0 indicates not presence of diabetics and 1 indicates presence of diabetics. 268 patients out of 768 are 1, the others are 0.
